<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is yesyu2 web-page</h1>
<h3 align="center">In this project, I prepared 3 different cards to express myself better in my Apply BAU application. My starting card is very short, it is the card where I talk about myself and links such as my social media account and LinkedIn account, and the card on the left is the card where I explain myself in more detail, show my skills and share my certificates. On the card on the right there is a link to the page where I show my projects. I designed my page inspired by the Dutch painter Rembrandt. I chose the colors inspired by my favorite painting, Pallas Athene. I used the paintings I chose from Rembrandt in the background of the cards.</h3>
